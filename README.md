==================

The Gallery resource module enables organizing, managing and viewing a gallery of images within your course. As a teacher, you are able to create, edit and delete galleries. For all images, small thumbnails are automatically generated, which are used for the thumbnail view of the gallery. Clicking on any of the thumbnails brings you to the presentation mode where you can browse through the images in large resolution and full-screen view (after clicking on a selected image).

For any image, users are able to leave comments on your gallery. If enabled, you can also add file attachments to each of the images, enhancing the content of your gallery by text and multimedia files.

If needed, the gallery module offers a specific set of permissions to allow students add their own images without being able to manage the gallery module itself. In this way, you can create a shared course image collection, run student image competitions etc.
